# Important Fix for GitHub Workflows

The workflows are failing on first run because there are no past predictions to evaluate. 

## Quick Fix

In your GitHub repository, edit the file `ChartScanAI_Shiny/evaluate_intraday_predictions.py`

Find this section around line 250-261:
```python
    # Return overall accuracy for CI/CD
    overall_accuracy = np.mean([performance[tf]['direction_accuracy'] for tf in ['1h', '3h', 'eod']])
    print(f"\nOverall Direction Accuracy: {overall_accuracy:.1f}%")
    
    # Exit with appropriate code
    if overall_accuracy >= 45:
        print("✓ Performance meets threshold")
        return 0
    else:
        print("✗ Performance below threshold")
        return 1
```

Replace it with:
```python
    # Return overall accuracy for CI/CD
    overall_accuracy = np.mean([performance[tf]['direction_accuracy'] for tf in ['1h', '3h', 'eod']])
    print(f"\nOverall Direction Accuracy: {overall_accuracy:.1f}%")
    
    # Check if this is the first run (no predictions evaluated)
    total_evaluated = sum(performance[tf]['total_predictions'] for tf in ['1h', '3h', 'eod'])
    
    if total_evaluated == 0:
        print("✓ First run - no past predictions to evaluate yet")
        print("  New predictions have been saved for future evaluation")
        return 0
    
    # Exit with appropriate code
    if overall_accuracy >= 45:
        print("✓ Performance meets threshold")
        return 0
    else:
        print("✗ Performance below threshold")
        return 1
```

## Files to Copy

Copy these files from `/home/thierrygc/test_1/github_ready/` to your Git repository:

1. `ChartScanAI_Shiny/evaluate_intraday_predictions.py` (with the fix above)
2. `test_market_check.py`
3. `download_nvda_historical.py` 
4. `show_prediction_summary.py`
5. `requirements.txt`
6. `.github/workflows/nvda_intraday_monitor.yml`
7. `.github/workflows/update_nvda_data.yml`
8. `.github/workflows/evaluate_nvda_patterns.yml`

Then commit and push to GitHub.
