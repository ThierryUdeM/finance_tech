# GitHub Actions Migration Notes

## Updated to Latest Action Versions (2024)

### Changes Made:

1. **actions/checkout**: v3 → v4
2. **actions/setup-python**: v4 → v5
3. **actions/cache**: v3 → v4
4. **actions/upload-artifact**: v3 → v4
5. **actions/download-artifact**: v3 → v4

### Output Syntax Update:

Old deprecated syntax:
```
echo "::set-output name=key::value"
```

New syntax:
```python
import os
with open(os.environ['GITHUB_OUTPUT'], 'a') as f:
    f.write(f'key=value\n')
```

### Why These Changes:

- GitHub deprecated v3 of artifact actions on April 16, 2024
- The old `::set-output` syntax is deprecated for security reasons
- v4 actions have better performance and security features

### Testing:

After pushing these changes:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Run workflow manually
3. Verify all steps complete successfully
4. Check that artifacts are uploaded

The workflow should now run without deprecation warnings!
