SIMPLE TECHNICAL MODELS - COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL SUMMARY
========================================================

Overview:
---------
The simple technical models are pure technical analysis systems that use traditional indicators
without machine learning components. They employ weighted scoring systems to generate trading signals
based on multiple technical indicators, each optimized for specific ticker characteristics.

Model Architecture:
------------------
- Type: Rule-based technical analysis systems
- Design: Weighted scoring with threshold-based signal generation
- Philosophy: Combine multiple technical indicators with ticker-specific optimizations

Common Framework:
----------------
- Standardized technical indicator suite
- Weighted scoring system for signal generation
- Walk-forward compatible design with no look-ahead bias
- Daily signal limits and quality filters

========================================================
TICKER-SPECIFIC MODEL DETAILS

- Sell threshold: -6.0
- Quality filters:
  - Volatility < 80th percentile
  - Distance from MA < 5%
  - Volume ratio > 0.3
- Maximum 1 signal per day per ticker

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Conservative thresholds for quality over quantity

   - MSFT: Balanced with dynamic adjustments
   - NVDA: Aggressive momentum strategy
   - TSLA: Conservative (using MSFT parameters)

2. Parameter Optimization:
   - Each model (except TSLA) has ticker-specific parameters
   - Weights reflect stock characteristics
   - Thresholds adjusted for trading frequency

3. Risk Management Approaches:
   - AAPL: Quality filters and volatility avoidance
   - MSFT/TSLA: Dynamic threshold adjustments
