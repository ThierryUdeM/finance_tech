MOMENTUM SHAPEMATCHING MODELS - COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL SUMMARY
=============================================================

Overview:
---------
The momentum shapematching models combine pattern recognition with momentum indicators to generate trading signals.
These models use historical pattern libraries and momentum-based features to predict future price movements.

Model Architecture:
------------------
- Type: Hybrid pattern matching + momentum systems
- Design: Machine learning-inspired pattern libraries with rule-based momentum signals
- Philosophy: Combines historical pattern similarity with real-time momentum indicators

Common Framework:
----------------
- Pattern library construction using normalized return patterns
- Euclidean distance-based pattern matching
- Weighted signal combination from multiple sources
- Daily signal limits and confidence thresholds
